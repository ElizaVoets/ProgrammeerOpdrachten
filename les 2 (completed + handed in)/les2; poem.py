"Crying the tears the maiden feels like she'd owe\n" 
"To fill up the river around the suffering willow\n"
"With emotions so beautiful a reality so ugly\n"
"Provide for the leaves that are hanging so lovely.\n"
"stupid and naive she obeyed every word\n"
"keep the willow to bloom to bring joy to the world.\n"
"The choice of saying no never came to mind.\n"
"Rather would make them happy and get left behind.\n"
"The feeling exhausting her eyes closing tight\n"
"Her story is something nobody will find\n"
"the wood so strong feeding on her tears\n"
"losing her mind is what the maiden fears\n"
"Knowing there wasnt an option to flee.\n"
"Always pleasing people while ignoring her needs\n"
"All she wanted was friendship what they fail to see.\n"
"Always alone as the days and nights were lonely.\n"
"Exhausting the maiden that will never be free.\n"
"The maiden that unfortunately happened to be me.")
